When I took the Bloc course, we built this project multiple times: first with plain Javascript, then with incorporated jQuery, and then in Angular. However after completing the course, the curriculum changed -- substituting Angular with React. I've been interested in React since first hearing about it and had experimented with it in my free time. I decided to continue with this new part of the curriculum, and build this project after having already completed the class. Learning a new language or framework can take time. I spent about a week learning about React before jumping into this project, and having already worked with Angular I found it fairly similar. I like the idea of single page applications, encapsulating components that manage their own state. Programming in general is all about breaking down problems into manageable pieces, which is fundamental to SPAs and React. The project consists of a landing page, a library page which holds all of the albums, and then the album page. I spent a significant amount of time styling the pages to give them a unique, clean look, while using Bootstrap to assist in making it responsive. I'm looking forward to building more robust applications with Redux in the near future.",

A lot of my day-to-day in my current profession is analyzing website data, and I've always been interested in learning how those tools work. Users insert a custom JavaScript snippet into projects of their choice, which creates a JSON object when an event is triggered. An external API call is made, and the event is recorded within tedmetrics. Feel free to look around the project by using the login: username: ted@tedmetrics.com password: password",
